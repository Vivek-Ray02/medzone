Doctors Appointment Booking Website

Description:
Aim of this project is to create a doctor appointment booking system that will help doctors in their work and will also help patients to book doctor appointments and reports. The system allows doctors to manage their booking slots online. Patients are allowed to book empty slots online and those slots are reserved in their name. The system manages the appointment data for multiple doctors of various date and
times. Each time a user visits a doctor his/her medical entry is stored in the database by the doctor. Next time a user logs in he/she may view his/her entire medical history as and when needed. At the same time a doctor may view a patient's previous medical history while the patient visits him.

Motivation:
As a patient we face many difficulties when we want to get an appointment for a doctor. When people get affected by illness they need to visit a doctor for checkup but for that they have to visit their clinic or hospital to get an appointment. It is a lengthy process and it wastes people’s time. Sometimes people do visit the doctor's clinic  for a health check up  but the doctor is not available for various reasons. The most important motive was to provide an easy way for patients to book appointments. So the primary focus remains on the appointment booking.

 ❏ Get appointment request
